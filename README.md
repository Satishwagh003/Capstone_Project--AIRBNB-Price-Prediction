## Project Goals
   In a rapidly evolving Airbnb marketplace, the project's core mission is to develop a predictive model for rental prices that benefits hosts by maximizing revenue and guests by ensuring fair and competitive rates. This problem is crucial due to the challenges hosts face in pricing their listings accurately and the importance of pricing for guests when making booking decisions. Accurate pricing not only enhances customer satisfaction but also contributes to the overall success and growth of Airbnb.

  # *AIRBNB USING NLP* 
   ## Project Goals
   In the context of Airbnb rental pricing, the project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze house rules and review per rate to better understand how these textual elements impact rental prices. By extracting insights from house rules and the selected feature, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can improve the accuracy of rental price predictions. This approach will benefit both hosts, by providing guidance on how to optimize their listings, and guests, by ensuring transparent and fair pricing.
